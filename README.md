# Big-Data-SPCL  
> A collection of ETL pipelines and predictive modelling projects for Big Data coursework  

## 🔍 Overview  
This repository contains two main components:  
- *ETL Pipeline Development* — workflows for extracting, transforming, and loading data into analysis-ready formats.  
- *Predictive Model* — modelling exercises based on the processed data, using Python and related analytics tools.  

The projects were developed as part of the “Big Data” specialisation (SPCL).

## 🚀 Getting Started  
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chainchigit/Big-Data-SPCL.git


Navigate to the relevant project directory

cd Big-Data-SPCL/ETL Pipeline Development


Install required packages (example using pip)

pip install -r requirements.txt


Follow the numbered folders (01 → 04) in sequence to build the pipeline.

After data is loaded, navigate to Predictive Model/ to run modelling notebooks.
